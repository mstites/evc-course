    "In 1879 Albert Michelson led an experimental campaign to measure the speed of light. His approach was a development upon the method of Foucault[3], and resulted in a new estimate of $v_0 = 299944 \\pm 51$ kilometers per second (in a vacuum). This is very close to the modern *exact* value of `r LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`. In this challenge, you will analyze Michelson's original data, and explore some of the factors associated with his experiment.\n",
