# Exercise Solutions

This is the solution manual for all exercises. The [tips exercise](https://zdelrosario.github.io/evc-course/exercises_solution/d02-e-tips-solution.html#solution-manual) provides more detailed "tactics" on how to work through these materials; in short, you should attempt the exercises on your own, and consult this manual when you get stuck, or when you're trying to remember how to do something.
