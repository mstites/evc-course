# Data Science for Engineers

Welcome to the website for "Data Science for Engineers"! This site is where I'll
post most of the materials for the summer course.

Please fill out this [time survey](https://whenisgood.net/y37sqdh) to help us find a time for live sessions. We will have one live session per week that will last one hour.

<!-- The [setup](setup) page has instructions on installing software for the course. -->

The course will start on June 12, 2022. I'll send out more information as we get closer to that date!
